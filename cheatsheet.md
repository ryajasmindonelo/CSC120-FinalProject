# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

Throughout the game the player may run into monsters. To defeat these monsters they must have already grabbed a weapon and type 'attack' when face to face with the monsters. The monsters include the T.Rex in the Bones Atrium, the spider in the Insect Zoo, the mummy in the Ancient Egypt Exhibit, the megalodon in the Marina Animals Hall, the lion in the Mammals Wing, the comet in the Planetarium, and the lasers in the Precious Items Display, which the player MUST defeat to win. The other monsters can be evaded if the player chooses the correct path, but it is unlikely
